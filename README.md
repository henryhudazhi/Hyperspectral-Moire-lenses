# Snapshot-hyperspectral-imaging-based-on-tunable-diffractive-Moire-lenses

The process of simulation in Snapshot hyperspectral imaging based on tunable diffractive Moire-lenses.
##
get_H.m: get the height maps of the DOEs

forward.m: get the simulated RGB PSFs 

simulatedPSF.py: verify our PSF simulation by LightPipes

(You can find LightPipe here http://www.okotech.com/lightpipes)

h1.mat, h2.mat: the height maps of 2 DOEs when the rotation angle is 30

h_460.mat, h_700.mat: the height map of 2 DOEs as a whole when the rotation angle is 45 and 30, respectively
